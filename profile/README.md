We also write short articles to publish our recent practices regarding Go here:

- [golang.design/research](https://golang.design/research): 🗞️ (Possibly) Naïve thoughts regarding Go.

More importantly, we created a documentary to help everyone to find interesting videos, discussions, design docs and etc. Here it is:
